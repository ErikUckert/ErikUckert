***What am I offering?***

I try to craft **simple** solutions with the minimum of technology needed for nice, neat and **beautiful** applications. 

***Isn't simple just ordinary?***

No! There is nothing wrong with using the absolute **minimum** on tools to craft a **solution** you own to a problem you fully understand.

***And why does it have to be beautiful, if simplicity does all the magic?***

Because simplicity itself is **beautiful** and my (and probably your) life is to short for dealing with all these unpleasant **applications** out there.

***So I'm kind of a warlock, who does have the answer to all dev & design questions everyone else fails at?***

Hell No! I'm just trying to get shit done in a way I can be proud of and with an outcome which is useful and pleasant.
